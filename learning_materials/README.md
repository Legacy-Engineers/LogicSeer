## 6. Suggested Development Workflow

1. **Define Problem Space**:

   - Break your goals into areas (e.g., NLP, Computer Vision, Big Data analysis).

2. **Build ML Pipelines**:

   - Incorporate modularity to allow LogicSeer to handle different ML problems flexibly.

3. **Create Prebuilt Modules**:

   - **NLP Tasks**: Sentiment Analysis, Document Classification.
   - **Vision Tasks**: Image Classification, Object Detection.
   - **Data Analysis Tasks**: Predictive Analytics for trading systems.

4. **Integrate a UI/UX**:

   - Use **SvelteKit** for frontend with interactive AI/ML inputs.
   - Use **WebSocket** for real-time interaction with the ML models.

5. **Implement a Plugin System**:
   - Allow third-party libraries or model plugins for extensibility.
