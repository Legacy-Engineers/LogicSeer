# Text Generation Model - README

## Project Overview

This repository aims to build and deploy a robust text generation model leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and libraries. The system is designed to generate coherent and meaningful text for various applications, including chatbots, content generation, summarization, and more.

## Key Features

- Implements transformer-based architectures (e.g., GPT, T5).
- Fine-tuning support for domain-specific text datasets.
- Efficient inference and scalability.
- Modular design for integration into larger systems.

## Libraries and Tools

### Core Frameworks

- **[Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/):** For pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/):** Flexible and Pythonic deep learning framework.
- **[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/):** For high-performance model training and serving (optional).

### Text Processing

- **[spaCy](https://spacy.io/):** For preprocessing, tokenization, and linguistic analysis.
- **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/):** Additional text processing utilities.
- **[Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/):** Topic modeling and document similarity (optional).

### Training Support

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generation-model.git
cd text-generation-model
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Pre-trained Model Initialization

Download a pre-trained model from Hugging Face (e.g., `gpt-2`).

```bash
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "gpt2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

### 4. Training (Optional)

Prepare your dataset:

- Ensure the dataset is in `.csv` or `.txt` format with appropriate preprocessing.
- Use the `datasets` library to streamline dataset handling.

Fine-tuning a model:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --model_name gpt2 --dataset_path ./data/train.csv --epochs 5
```

### 5. Deployment

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Test the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Your input text here."}'
```
